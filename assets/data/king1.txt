The dimensional portal is opened! You have no way to stop me now!

To me, you are just a result of a failed experiment! You should have been transformed into a monster -- just like the ones you have killed. But somehow one tiny system error was enough for you to retain the human form. So before I leave for the new space-time destination, I will fix this error myself!
