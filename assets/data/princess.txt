Thank you for rescuing me! The rumor is true -- my father King Lionel is still alive!

Last month I heard the rumors that King Lionel had been seen in this Sun Temple. I was so shocked that I decided to search for him by myself.

After a dangerous journey to this place I finally found my father, King Lionel. He looked and acted very different from the loving father I remembered. He was standing right before me, yet I scarcely recognized him. He demanded my Phoenix Ring! I hesitated and suddenly he attacked me! I was overwhelmed by his incredible strength and speed and I was easily defeated. However, I was able to hide the Ring from him. After he failed to find it, he decided to lock me here.

Thank you again for saving me, but I can not bring myself to fight the man who once was my loving father. Please take my Phoenix Ring and wear it! It will help to stop my father from doing more evil, and it will help to finally bring peace to these lands.
