Are you the mysterious traveler from the southern desert? If so, then perhaps you are the only hope left for this suffering kingdom.

Years ago, my beloved King Lionel vanished in the northern mountains, and since that day monsters and sorrow have tormented our land.

And now… my daughter, Princess Sarah, has been captured during her trip to the Sun Temple. I sent forth my finest knights to save her, yet none have returned. Every day I fear I will never see her again.

Please, I beg you—not only as Queen, but as a mother—save my daughter and restore peace in our kingdom. If you agree to rescue her, to help on your journey I shall grant you a precious key that unlocks one of the treasure chambers within this palace.
